# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project demonstrates **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that combines document retrieval with large language model for question answering.

## Overview

The notebook `rag.ipynb` showcases how to enhance language model responses by integrating relevant external information retrieved from a document store or knowledge base. This approach allows the model to generate more accurate, context-aware, and up-to-date answers.

## Features

- Document retrieval using vector similarity search  
- Context-aware generation leveraging large language models  
- Easily adaptable for different datasets or document sources  
- End-to-end demonstration in a single Jupyter notebook
